I presented a platform talk at the 2025 BMES annual meeting in San Diego, California. This was my first time presenting my work as a PhD student in the Randles Lab. My talk focused on a computationally-efficient approach for simulating adhesive tumor cell transport using a method called adaptive physics refinement. With this framework, we are able to simulate cancer cells in the bloodstream interacting with red blood cells and endothelial receptors at physiologically relevant scale to better understand metastasis.

This was also my first time attending the BMES conference, and I had a great time learning about a wide-range of research topics as well as exploring the city of San Diego with my fellow lab members. I look forward to more opportunities to travel and share my work in the future!
