I was awarded the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, which will help support my graduate education. The NSF GRFP provides a three-year annual stipend of $37,000 in addition to a $16,000 education allowance for tuition and fees. I am grateful for my advisor Prof. Denis Tsygankov for helping me develop my research goals, and I also want to thank everyone who gave me feedback on my essay drafts. 

I am excited to begin my graduate education as an NSF Fellow in the [Randles lab](https://randleslab.pratt.duke.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Duke University, where I will pursue a PhD in Biomedical Engineering.
