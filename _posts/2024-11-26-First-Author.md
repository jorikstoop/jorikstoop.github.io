I'm happy to announce that my first 1st-author journal article was published today! In the summer of 2023 I worked in Dr. Taiji Adachi's Biomechanics Lab at Kyoto University where I researched bone biomechanics and biochemical signaling. My work with Dr. Yuka Yokoyama and Professor Adachi focuses on how the signaling molecule PTHrP plays an important role in maintaining the growth plate during bone development. In this study we use an innovative computational modeling method to simulate tissue morphogenesis in 3D with cell-specific regulation. I'm super proud to have my work published and I'm very thankful for the guidance of my mentors in the [Biomechanics Lab](https://www2.infront.kyoto-u.ac.jp/bf05/index-e.html){:target="_blank"}.
