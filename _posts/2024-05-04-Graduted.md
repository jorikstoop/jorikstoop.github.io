Wow, four years went by fast! I'm proud to have graduated with a B.S in Biomedical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology having achieved a 4.0 GPA and completed an undergraduate thesis for the [research option](https://urop.gatech.edu/researcher-profiles/jorik-stoop){:target="_blank"}. I'm also grateful to have received the [Outstanding Senior in BME Award](https://bme.gatech.edu/news/coulter-bme-announces-spring-2024-department-award-student-winners){:target="_blank"}, and for being able to celebrate with my friends.
