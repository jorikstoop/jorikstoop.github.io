Hi! I am Jorik Stoop and I am a first-year PhD student at Duke University. My research interests include computational modeling and biomechanics, and I am currently working on developing models of blood flow and tumor cell transport in the [Randles lab](https://randleslab.pratt.duke.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

Outside of research, some of the things I love include sports, music, the outdoors, and traveling. I hope you enjoy checking out my website!
